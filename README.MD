#_*ViRT*_

##What is ViRT?  

Virt is an app that lets you find something to do when you're in a new neighborhood or you aren't  sure what's going on at this moment. You can search according to your preferences in taste, distance, and whether or not you're into paying a small cover or just want something free to see.

##_The Business Owners_  

Small venues, clubs (heck, even restaurants!) can increase their attendance and crowds by creating their free ViRT accounts, posting a quick _advirtisement_ about their unique event and it will appear in the search results for people nearby looking to check something cool out.


##_The Crowds_  

Ever thought of wanting to see a band or go dancing but not sure what's happening or...where? You bet we have.  The masses can use Google to login and start searching for performances and events so you don't have to spend an hour searching online.
